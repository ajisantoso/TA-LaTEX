%\chapter*{Abstract}
  Emergency medical situation are conditions in which a rapid response is required from patient itself, family, or anyone nearby. In case of Emergency everyone is deemed to have obligation to make quick decision taking the patient to hospital for medical treatment. Transporting severely injured patients in emergency case can by time consuming and resource consuming. This practical application of our system can be used to determining suitable hospital for patient in timely manner.  Several objective and criteria should be considered to increase the patientâ€™s life expectancy. In this study, we build Expert System (ES) to obtain suitable hospital using criteria patient conditions, travel time, availability of doctor, availability of operating room, ICU, and ICCU rooms. An Expert System built upon knowledge base model, this knowledge stored into rule and processed by inference engine using Rete Algorithm which is built from Rete network. The relationship in between nodes in Rete Algorithm designed to eliminate redundancy of computer processes of Expert System. Through the using of the Rete algorithm on the rule based system, the speed and efficiency of computing by reducing the effort made for repeated computation of the conflict set after the rule is executed.
